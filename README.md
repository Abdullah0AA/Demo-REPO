# Demo

Some discription!

This file was created in GitHub, then was called to vscode using the terminal command: <git clone (Paste SSH Key from your GitHub)>

## Subheader 

This subheader was wirtten in vscode.
The goal is to save this change to the repository.
1. Save changes in Git: 
 The commanad <git status> --> Shows all files which were created, updated or deleted, BUT are NOT saved in a (commit) yet.
            EXAMPLE: - modified Files like this README file will be shown next to the RED word modified.
                     - created files will be shown under (Untracked files:) --> Track file using - <git add .> Period (.) means track all files listed unter git status
                                                                                                  - <git add neamOFfile.extentionOFfile>
2. use <git status> to make sure. It should show the changes in green. That means --> changes were tracked and ready to be committed.
3. Commit changes using <git commit -m " title of commit new file" -m " Discription box: Here you can write what and why changed ">

4. NOW the changes are saved locally, BUT NOT live on GitHub yet.
This can be done using the command <git push>
